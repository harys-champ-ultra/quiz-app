# Basic Quiz Website

## Project Description:
The project is a basic quiz website developed using PHP, CSS (SCSS), and MySQL. The website consists of two types of users: clients and admins.
For clients, the website provides a user-friendly interface. When a client visits the website, they are redirected to the sign-in page. If they are new users, they can create an account through the sign-up process. The website includes robust form validation to ensure data integrity.
Once signed in, clients have access to a dashboard with various options. They can start a quiz, solve quiz sets, participate in community quizzes, contribute their own quizzes to the community, view their own quizzes, edit their own quizzes, delete their own quizzes, and check the results of quizzes they have taken.
Admin users follow a similar sign-in and sign-up process as clients. Once signed in, admins are redirected to the admin dashboard. Admins have additional privileges and responsibilities. They can add quiz sets, each containing multiple quizzes. They can add new quizzes, view existing quizzes, edit quizzes, and delete quizzes. Admins also have the ability to manage user accounts by deleting or blocking clients.
